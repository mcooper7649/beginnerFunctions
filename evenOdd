// Hello! Below are some exercises and examples to help you become more accustomed to the concepts in the prep-work.

// As a quick demonstration, here is an array of numbers:
var testArr = [1,2,3,4,5]

// We can loop through the array to print each of the numbers on their own line. You'll format a loop to iterate over each item of the array, starting from the first element:

for (let i = 0; i < testArr.length; i++) { 
  // An array item at a specific position is notated by the name of the array with [] next to it indicating its index. For example:
  console.log(testArr[i]) 
}

// Practice exercise:

// Now it's your turn! Create an array of 5 numbers, and find the sum of them by looping through them. The sum has been declared for you:

var practiceArr = [2, 4, 4, 9, 1] 
var sum = 0 // keep this variable as 0, and add onto it when you loop


// Code goes here:

for (var i = 0; i < practiceArr.length; i++) {
  sum += practiceArr[i];
}

//////////

// Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and prints "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

// Hint, you'll need to use the modulus operator (this thing: %)

function even_or_odd(number) {
  // your code goes here
  if (number % 2 === 0)
    console.log("This is a even number!")
  
  else console.log("This number is odd!")
 
}

even_or_odd(45);
even_or_odd(456456);
even_or_odd(368907);
even_or_odd(34534534534.97);
